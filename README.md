# Netlify Deployment Project

Project Description
This is an educational project created to learn about distributed systems and continuous deployment (CD) using GitHub Actions and Netlify.

What is the application about?
This application is a simple static website that demonstrates:

- Basic Web Development: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automation with GitHub Actions
- Hosting Platform: Automatic deployment on Netlify

Components
1. `index.html`
   - Simple webpage titled "Hello World"
   - Contains a greeting: "Hello World"
   - Includes an interactive button

2. `app.js`
   - Adds a click handler that displays an alert
   - Message: "Hello World!"

3. `styles.css`
   - Centered design with light background (#f7f9fc)
   - Arial-like font
   - Button styling with pointer cursor

4. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/netlify-deploy.yml`)
   - The workflow automates deployment to Netlify:
     - Trigger: Executes automatically when pushing to the `main` branch
     - Validation: (optional) verifies repository/files
     - Installation: Installs Netlify CLI
     - Deployment: Deploys the `public/` folder to Netlify using authentication token and site id

Deployment Flow

Deployment to Netlify (Automatic)
1. The developer pushes changes to the `main` branch.
2. GitHub Actions is automatically triggered.
3. Netlify CLI is installed in the runner.
4. The `public/` folder is deployed to Netlify using `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`.
5. The site is available in production on the Netlify-provided domain.

Deployment with Docker (Local)

Option 1: Docker
```powershell
# Build the image
docker build -t netlify-app .;

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 netlify-app

# The application will be available at http://localhost:8080
```

Option 2: Docker Compose (if you add a compose file)
```powershell
# Start the container
docker compose up -d

# The application will be available at http://localhost:8080

# Stop the container
docker compose down
```

Educational Purpose
This project was created for educational purposes to learn about:

- Basic web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Automation with GitHub Actions
- Web application deployment
- Modern hosting platforms (Netlify)
- Distributed systems concepts
- Containerization with Docker

Docker Requirements
- Docker installed (version 20.10 or higher)
- Docker Compose (included with Docker Desktop)

Notes
- Netlify: The project uses a Netlify token stored in GitHub secrets (`NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`) and the site id (`NETLIFY_SITE_ID`).
- GitHub Actions: Deployment is fully automatic when secrets are configured.
- Docker: Uses `nginx:alpine` in the `Dockerfile` to serve static files efficiently.
